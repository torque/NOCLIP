== nearly obvious command line interface parser

A zig library for composing declarative command-line interfaces. Heavily
inspired by https://click.palletsprojects.com/[click] for Python.

== Extemporaneous Bloviation

[quote, George "Albert Einstein" Washington]
____
The alarm rings, and expletives spill from my mouthâ€”instinctively, before any
neuron has a chance to fire. You'd think this would get easier, having done it
at least 12000 times, but I guess it just goes to show that practice does not
necessarily converge on perfection, no matter what infinite limit t approaches.
Eyes clamped shut against the encroaching underglow spilling from the curtains,
I stretch my arms straight out from my sides and proceed to lose my balance,
flying horizontally off of the mattress. An attempt at attitude control fails
vigorously and I begin cartwheeling through open space, asserting a lopsided
trajectory that intersects with the roof of the house. Passing through it
unencumbered, I careen skyward and watch the ground recede into the distance,
as the features of the landscape shrink and pop out of existence.

== Hello

Requires Zig `0.10.0` or maybe better. Uses stage2-only features.

=== Features

* short- (`-s`) and long- (`--long`) style options
* short options can be chained (e.g. `-abc` is the same as `-a -b -c`)
* conventional `--` to force early of argument parsing
* option values are deserialized into rich types using conversion callback functions
* can specify default values for options that may be omitted
* options can be bound to load from environmental variables if not specified directly
* nested subcommands (e.g. for `git`-style CLIs (`command subcommand subsubcommand`))

=== Planned

* help text generation
* better error reporting
* better build system

=== Under consideration

* multi-value option flags
* shell completion integration
* `--long=value` style of value specification
* Is it actually possible for a published written document to truly be
extemporaneous?

=== Use

`zig build demo` for a demo. Otherwise just copy the file or use a submodule or
something.
